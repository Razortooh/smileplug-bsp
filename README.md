WiFi Conifguration Notes

The Wireless Module, AP-8764 has it's source code for the driver released under GPLv2 license (see above).   The
localation of the configuration tools man pages or detailed docs specific to the AP-8764 are proprietary and only
available through the tools vendors.  Because the tools are GPLv2, the sources for the tools should be published
somewhere.  

Here are some basic notes in GIST form to cover WPA2 configuration: https://gist.github.com/truedat101/6646367

* Default Root and SUDO configuration, see: http://archlinuxarm.org/support/guides/system/first-steps
* No other non-default users

Added for testing:

Some manual commands to run in the configuration of a new BSP based on arch:

* For UFW, open all connections from the associated networks for the administrative 
  network 10.0.0.0 and the default WIFI AP network 10.1.0.0
    # This generates the /usr/lib/ufw/user.conf commands used to store the rules
    ufw allow from 10.0.0.0/24
    ufw allow from 10.1.0.0/24
* setup the timezone for America/Los_Angeles
/etc/localtime -> /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Los_Angeles
* Configure time: 
    > ntpd -qg (Need to set up NTP at this point or else openssl won't work properly )
    > hwclock -w

Arch Linux ARM Tips
===================

* Until we complete the migration to the mainline Arch Linux ARM community release (and more modern kernel), it is not recommended to attempt to run a complete upgrade
* If you need to install packages from AUR, you minimally will want to run as root: pacman -Sy <package name>

Roadmap
=======

* 0.6.0 - Complete migration to mainlain Arch Linux ARM distro
